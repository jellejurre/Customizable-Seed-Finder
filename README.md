# Customisable Seed Finder

## Install Instructions

Download the published file under publications, open a terminal in the location of the file, and execute `java -jar CustimizableSeedFinder.jar`.

It will then ask for your preferences on the seed to find, after which it will generate some stats it needs to run (which might take multiple minutes), and start seedfinding.

P.S. this might generate two folders in the map where you placed the checker: "poi" and "data". This is because of the use of the seed-checker library which uses minecraft code, which generates those folders. These folders are harmless and a byproduct of lazy coding.
